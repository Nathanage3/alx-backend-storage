**NoSQL** stands for "Not Only SQL". It's a term used to describe a new generation of databases that do not rely on the traditional relational database structure. Instead, they use a variety of data models, including document, key-value, wide-column, and graph¹²³⁵.

Here are some key points about NoSQL:

1. **Non-Relational**: NoSQL databases are non-relational, meaning they do not use tables for storing data. Instead, they can store data in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, JSON-like documents, wide columns, or graphs¹²⁵.

2. **Flexible Schema**: NoSQL databases have a flexible schema. This means that unlike relational databases, which require a predefined schema, NoSQL databases allow the schema to be defined during data insertion¹². This is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, giving developers a lot of flexibility¹.

3. **Scalability**: NoSQL databases are designed to scale out by distributing the data across many servers. This makes them a good choice for applications that need to handle large amounts of data and high user loads¹².

4. **Types of NoSQL Databases**: There are several types of NoSQL databases, each with its own specific use-cases¹²⁵:

   - **Document databases** store data in a semi-structured format like JSON. They are great for content management systems and user profiles².
   - **Key-value databases** are the simplest type of NoSQL databases. They store data as a collection of key-value pairs and are great for caching and storing user preferences².
   - **Wide-column stores** store data in rows and columns, but unlike relational databases, the names and format of the columns can vary from row to row. They are great for analyzing large datasets².
   - **Graph databases** focus on the relationships between data and are great for social networks and recommendation systems².

5. **History of NoSQL**: NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as the cost of storage dramatically decreased. Developers were becoming the primary cost of software development, so NoSQL databases optimized for developer productivity¹. As storage costs rapidly decreased, the amount of data that applications needed to store and query increased. This data came in all shapes and sizes — structured, semi-structured, and polymorphic — and defining the schema in advance became nearly impossible¹.

6. **When to Use NoSQL**: NoSQL databases are a good choice when you need scalability and flexibility, especially when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data. They are also a good choice when you need to be able to make changes to the database schema without downtime¹.
